Data Sets Explorer may be used to explore any data set here i limited my self to three data sets only
       
if you chose:

1-plot :The app wil calculate the correlations between all the variables in the data sets

and show nice heat map exploring these correlations .

2-summary : you will get summary of the data set. 

3- view: you will show you the first n rows of the data sets based on the value you enter in the number of 

the observations the numeric input box. 

4-Structure: you will get the general structure of the data set.
